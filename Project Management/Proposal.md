# NBA: No Bad (players) Allowed

### Title: 
# Forecasting Basketball Player Positions Using Machine Learning

### Team Members:
## Andrew Walker, Benji Hawkins, David Seger, Rachidi Ndongala

### Project Description:
In this project, we are going to use an dataset containing NBA statistics and records from 1950 to the present. Using a selection of the 60+ features contained in the dataset, we will train a machine learning model to predict player position based on player attributes. After completing the modelling and testing phases, using Tableau, we would like to create a visual interpretation of what the model is doing behind the scenes. As a final goal, we want to use this model to forecast ideal NBA positions for college basketball players entering the NBA draft. 

### Data Source:
“NBA Players stats since 1950” on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats?select=Seasons_Stats.csv)

### Tools Used:
- Python machine learning libraries (scikit-learn and/or tensorflow) for creating machine learning models.
- Pandas for dataset manipulation.
- Tableau for dataset visualization and story functionality.
