### [Data_Preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/blhawkins/NBAForecasting/blob/main/Data%20%26%20Pre-Processing/data_preprocessing.ipynb)
Components of the data_preprocessing.ipynb file include:
1. Use of Python and Pandas commands to clean the season_stats.csv dataset and remove extraneous information.
2. Segregation of features into percentage-based statistics (Assist Percentage, Total Rebound Percentage, ect.) and raw-valued statistics (Number of Assists, Number of Total Reounds ect.).
3. Percentage-based dataset saved as [percent_stats.csv](https://github.com/blhawkins/NBAForecasting/blob/main/Data%20%26%20Pre-Processing/percent_stats.csv) and raw-valued dataset saved as[raw_stats.csv](https://github.com/blhawkins/NBAForecasting/blob/main/Data%20%26%20Pre-Processing/raw_stats.csv)
